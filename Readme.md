<h1> Fully Automated Instagram Image Uploader </h1>
<h2> Prompt Engineering and Stable Diffusion </h2>
This project uses a sort of plug and play method to engineer the prompts before feeding them into Stable Diffusion via ComfyUI. 
<h2> Caption Generation </h2>
Captions are generated by llama3 via Ollama, with hastags being hardcoded in. 
<h2> Image Uploading </h2>
Usage of instagrapi, was detected by Instagram, and thus scripting seems to be the smartest way to do it, albeit rudimentary.
Yet to experiment with UIAutomator2 due to computational restraints.
